# Naming

## Capitalization

The term `Markdown` is considered a proper noun and so we'll capitalize when in use.

## TODO

* I'd like more formalized rules for when, inside inline documentation, I should use the full module name `Franklin.Articles.Article` or `Article` or "article".
* I find myself writing decision documents in the "royal we". Is that good?
